## It's a dogs life...

This is a demonstration of how to organize a scene-based game in React. This question arose with a student at [codebar.io](https://codebar.io/), and the example was a bit long to develop with the student at the time.

Here are the key features I'm attempting to demonstrate:
- Using react markup to create scenes that can have flexible behaviour and look
- Showing how to share common bits of functionality
- Using react router to switch between scenes
- Add a simple scoring facility
- To show that I am not a good artist!

This is based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) ([instructions on using this](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md)).

## Quick setup

Install node (tested on v10)
```
npm install
npm start
```

# The Game

The game is comprised of scenes that tell a small part of the story through text boxes that appear. Clicking anywhere on the screen moves through the story. Occasionally questions are asked before you can continue, which I will use to score and unlock the next scene.
